# Oracle Principal Data Scientist Project: Energy Usage Optimization

## Overview

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end data science project focused on forecasting and optimizing energy usage, integrating renewable sources (DERs), detecting anomalies, and leveraging GenAI for explainable insights. The approach reflects real-world scenarios encountered by utilities and aligns with the responsibilities of a Principal Data Scientist at Oracleâ€™s Energy and Water product team.

## Key Features

- **Load Forecasting:**  
  Uses deep learning models (LSTMs or Transformers) and classical ML methods (Gradient Boosted Trees) to predict energy consumption, integrating time series features such as weather conditions, holidays, and historical load patterns.

- **Anomaly Detection:**  
  Identifies irregular consumption patterns and potential grid outages using Gaussian Mixture Models and Isolation Forest.

- **GenAI Integration:**  
  Leverages a locally fine-tuned language model to automatically generate human-readable summaries, explain anomalies, and provide context through a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

- **MLOps & Cloud Deployment:**  
  Implements containerization (Docker), CI/CD pipelines, model versioning, automated retraining, and cloud environment simulations for production-readiness.

- **Visualization & Dashboards:**  
  Offers an interactive dashboard (via Plotly/Dash or Streamlit) displaying forecasts, anomalies, feature importance, and scenario simulations for stakeholders.

## Repository Structure
