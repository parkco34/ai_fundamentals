Your response is very comprehensive and well thought-out. Here are a few minor adjustments I might suggest:

- **Optional Date Format Parameter:** Allow users to pass in custom date formats as an optional parameter. This adds flexibility if the auto-detection doesn't catch every case.

- **Logging Module:** Instead of using print statements for logging, consider using Python’s built-in logging module. This provides more control over log levels and is more suitable for production environments.

- **Helper Functions:** Breaking the function into smaller helper functions (e.g., one for detecting the format and one for converting dates) could improve readability and maintainability.

- **Input Validation:** While you already mention creating a copy for data safety, explicitly checking the input type (ensuring it’s a pandas DataFrame) and handling that gracefully would be a nice touch.

- **Extensibility:** Consider documenting how additional date formats can be integrated, perhaps by maintaining a list of format strings that the function iterates through.

These tweaks could further enhance the robustness and flexibility of your function without significantly altering its core functionality.
