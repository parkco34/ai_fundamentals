It looks like you've made good progress on your assignment by implementing several reinforcement learning algorithms for the CartPole-v0 problem. However, there are a few issues and incomplete parts in your code that need to be addressed to fully meet the assignment requirements.

Below, I'll guide you through the necessary corrections, explain how to complete the missing parts, and ensure you understand each component of the assignment.

---

## Part 1: Tabular Methods with Discretization

### 1. State Space Discretization

You've correctly defined bins for each of the four state variables and created a mapping function (`discrete`) to convert continuous observations into discrete states. This is essential for applying tabular methods to environments with continuous state spaces.

**Action Items:**

- Ensure your `discrete` function handles edge cases where the state might be outside the predefined bins.

### 2. Policy Iteration

Your current implementation of `policy_evaluation` and `policy_improvement` functions needs refinement.

**Issues:**

- **Policy Evaluation:**
  - The function `policy_evaluation` has indentation issues and typos (e.g., `cotinuous_state` should be `continuous_state`).
  - The return statement is inside the for-loop, which will cause the function to return after the first iteration.
  - The function currently uses TD(0) updates, which is acceptable but not the standard iterative policy evaluation.

- **Policy Improvement:**
  - The function lacks a proper calculation of the action-value function \( Q(s, a) \).
  - Iterating over all possible states and actions without considering the size of the state space (which is huge) is impractical.

**Action Items:**

- **Policy Evaluation:**
  - Fix the typos and indentation issues.
  - Modify the function to perform iterative updates over the value function until convergence. Given the large state space, consider reducing the bin size or using a sampling approach.

- **Policy Improvement:**
  - Implement a more efficient method for policy improvement, perhaps by sampling a subset of states.
  - Calculate \( Q(s, a) \) properly using the environment's dynamics or by approximating it.

**Example Corrections:**

```python
def policy_evaluation(policy, bins, value_func, discount=EXAMPLE_DISCOUNT,
                      theta=1e-5, max_iterations=1000):
    for i in range(max_iterations):
        delta = 0
        for state_indices in itertools.product(range(len(bins[0])), repeat=4):
            state = tuple(state_indices)
            v = value_func[state]
            action = policy[state]
            # Simulate taking the action and getting the next state and reward
            # Since we don't have the model, consider using samples or skip this
            # For simplicity, you might need to adjust the approach
            # Update value function
            value_func[state] = ...  # Implement the update
            delta = max(delta, abs(v - value_func[state]))
        if delta < theta:
            break
    return value_func
```

### 3. Temporal Difference Learning (SARSA and Q-Learning)

Your implementations of SARSA and Q-Learning look solid, but there are minor issues to fix.

**Issues:**

- In the `sarsa` function, ensure that `alpha` and `epsilon` are correctly updated.

**Action Items:**

- Verify that the decay of `epsilon` and the learning rate `alpha` are correctly implemented to ensure proper convergence.

### 4. Monte Carlo Methods

Your `monte_carlo` function implements the First-Visit MC method, which is appropriate.

**Issues:**

- Ensure that you're handling the action-value function updates correctly and efficiently.

**Action Items:**

- Consider using incremental updates to avoid storing all returns for each state-action pair.

### 5. Performance Evaluation

You've implemented the `performance_evaluation` function to plot learning curves, which is great.

**Action Items:**

- After correcting the above issues, run all your algorithms and generate the learning curves.
- Compare their performance in terms of convergence speed, stability, and final policy quality.

## Part 2: Function Approximation

### 1. Linear Function Approximation

Your attempt to implement TD learning with linear function approximation is on the right track, but it needs some corrections.

**Issues:**

- **Feature Vector (`get_features`):**
  - The action should be one-hot encoded since it's a categorical variable.
  - The feature vector should be compatible with the weight vector `theta`.

- **Linear Q-Learning Function:**
  - The variable `timestep` is not defined within the function.
  - There are typos in variable names (e.g., `epsiode` should be `episode`).
  - The function needs to handle the dimensions of `theta` and features correctly.

**Action Items:**

- **Define the Number of Features:**

  ```python
  num_state_features = env.observation_space.shape[0]  # Should be 4
  num_actions = env.action_space.n  # Should be 2
  num_features = num_state_features + num_actions  # Total features
  ```

- **Modify `get_features` Function:**

  ```python
  def get_features(state, action):
      action_one_hot = np.zeros(env.action_space.n)
      action_one_hot[action] = 1
      features = np.concatenate([state, action_one_hot])
      return features
  ```

- **Correct the `linear_q_learning` Function:**

  ```python
  def linear_q_learning(
      theta,
      episodes=EXAMPLE_EPISODES,
      discount=EXAMPLE_DISCOUNT,
      alpha=EXAMPLE_ALPHA,
      epsilon=EXAMPLE_EPSILON,
      epsilon_decay=EXAMPLE_EPSILON_DECAY,
      epsilon_min=EXAMPLE_EPSILON_MIN,
      timestep=EXAMPLE_TIMESTEP
  ):
      episode_rewards = []
      for episode in range(1, episodes+1):
          state, _ = env.reset()
          total_reward = 0
          done = False
          while not done:
              if np.random.random() < epsilon:
                  action = env.action_space.sample()
              else:
                  q_vals = []
                  for act in range(env.action_space.n):
                      features = get_features(state, act)
                      q_value = np.dot(theta, features)
                      q_vals.append(q_value)
                  action = np.argmax(q_vals)
              next_state, reward, done, _, _ = env.step(action)
              if done:
                  td_target = reward
              else:
                  next_q_vals = []
                  for act in range(env.action_space.n):
                      next_features = get_features(next_state, act)
                      next_q_value = np.dot(theta, next_features)
                      next_q_vals.append(next_q_value)
                  td_target = reward + discount * np.max(next_q_vals)
              current_features = get_features(state, action)
              td_error = td_target - np.dot(theta, current_features)
              theta += alpha * td_error * current_features
              state = next_state
              total_reward += reward
          epsilon = max(epsilon * epsilon_decay, epsilon_min)
          episode_rewards.append(total_reward)
          if episode % timestep == 0:
              avg_reward = np.mean(episode_rewards[-timestep:])
              print(f"Linear Q-Learning -> Episode: {episode}, Average Reward: {avg_reward:.2f}, Epsilon: {epsilon:.4f}")
      return episode_rewards, theta
  ```

### 2. Non-Linear Function Approximation (Neural Networks)

Your `QNetwork` class has some syntax errors and needs to be adjusted.

**Issues:**

- **Incorrect Inheritance and Typos:**
  - The class should inherit from `nn.Module`, not `nn.module`.
  - Typos in the `forward` method (e.g., `torch.reul` should be `torch.relu`).

- **Missing Components:**
  - Need to implement experience replay and target network for stability.

**Action Items:**

- **Correct the `QNetwork` Class:**

  ```python
  class QNetwork(nn.Module):
      def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, hidden_units=64):
          super(QNetwork, self).__init__()
          self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_size, hidden_units)
          self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_units, hidden_units)
          self.fc3 = nn.Linear(hidden_units, action_size)
      def forward(self, state):
          x = torch.relu(self.fc1(state))
          x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
          x = self.fc3(x)
          return x
  ```

- **Implement DQN Algorithm:**
  - Use experience replay buffer to store and sample experiences.
  - Use a target network to stabilize training.

- **Sample DQN Implementation:**

  ```python
  import random
  from collections import deque

  def dqn(
      episodes=EXAMPLE_EPISODES,
      discount=EXAMPLE_DISCOUNT,
      epsilon=EXAMPLE_EPSILON,
      epsilon_decay=EXAMPLE_EPSILON_DECAY,
      epsilon_min=EXAMPLE_EPSILON_MIN,
      batch_size=64,
      update_target_every=5
  ):
      state_size = env.observation_space.shape[0]
      action_size = env.action_space.n
      main_network = QNetwork(state_size, action_size)
      target_network = QNetwork(state_size, action_size)
      target_network.load_state_dict(main_network.state_dict())
      optimizer = optim.Adam(main_network.parameters(), lr=EXAMPLE_ALPHA)
      memory = deque(maxlen=2000)
      episode_rewards = []

      for episode in range(1, episodes+1):
          state, _ = env.reset()
          state = torch.FloatTensor(state)
          total_reward = 0
          done = False
          while not done:
              if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
                  action = env.action_space.sample()
              else:
                  with torch.no_grad():
                      q_values = main_network(state)
                  action = torch.argmax(q_values).item()
              next_state, reward, done, _, _ = env.step(action)
              next_state_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(next_state)
              memory.append((state, action, reward, next_state_tensor, done))
              state = next_state_tensor
              total_reward += reward

              if len(memory) >= batch_size:
                  minibatch = random.sample(memory, batch_size)
                  # Extract tensors from minibatch and perform training
                  # ...

          epsilon = max(epsilon * epsilon_decay, epsilon_min)
          episode_rewards.append(total_reward)
          if episode % update_target_every == 0:
              target_network.load_state_dict(main_network.state_dict())
          if episode % EXAMPLE_TIMESTEP == 0:
              avg_reward = np.mean(episode_rewards[-EXAMPLE_TIMESTEP:])
              print(f"DQN -> Episode: {episode}, Average Reward: {avg_reward:.2f}, Epsilon: {epsilon:.4f}")
      return episode_rewards
  ```

  **Note:** You'll need to fill in the training loop with the appropriate loss function and optimizer steps.

### 3. Monte Carlo Methods with Function Approximation

Implementing MC methods with function approximation involves using the total returns from each episode to update the function approximator.

**Action Items:**

- Modify your linear or neural network function approximator to update weights based on the observed returns.

**Example Approach:**

- Collect all state-action-reward sequences in an episode.
- At the end of the episode, compute the return \( G_t \) for each time step.
- Update the weights to minimize the difference between the predicted Q-values and the observed returns.

### 4. Performance Evaluation

After implementing the function approximation methods, compare their performance with the tabular methods.

**Action Items:**

- Use the `performance_evaluation` function to plot learning curves for each method.
- Analyze the impact of function approximation on learning speed and policy quality.
- Discuss how hyperparameters and network architecture affect performance.
