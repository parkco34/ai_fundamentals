# Part 2: Function Approximation
## 1. Linear Function Approximation
**Objective:** Implement TD learning with linear function approximation.
**Instructions:**
- Represent the Q-function as a linear combination of features.

## 2. Non-Linear Function Approximation (Neural Networks)
**Objective:** Implement TD learning with neural networks.
**Instructions:**
- Design a neural network to approximate the Q-function.
- Decide on the architecture (number of layers, neurons, activation functions).

## 3. Monte Carlo Methods with Function Approximation
**Objective:** Combine MC methods with function approximation.
**Instructions:**
- Use the returns from episodes to update the function approximator.
- Ensure that the function approximator generalizes well across states.

## 4. Performance Evaluation
**Objective:** Compare the performance of function approximation methods with tabular methods.
**Instructions:**
- Use the same evaluation metrics as before.
- Discuss the impact of function approximation on learning speed and policy quality.
- Analyze the effects of hyperparameters and network architecture.
